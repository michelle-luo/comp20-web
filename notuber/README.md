In this assignment I send a request to the server and receive a JSON containing
vehicle data. Then using the Google Maps API, I display my own location and all
the vehicles' location on a map. To see the distance between the passenger and
a car, click the car.

Thanks to iconfinder.com for the passenger icon.

I spent approximately 4 hours on this assignment.
