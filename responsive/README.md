#Comp 20 Lab 4 - Responsive Design

In this lab, the sprites displayed in the browser changed based on the browser
width. A different sprite is displayed for when width is 1400 or greater,
when width is between 1200 and 1400, between 1000 and 1200, between 800 and 
1000, between 600 and 800, and when width is less than 600.

Thanks to San Akdag for helping point out that the proper media query is 
"min-width", not "min-device-width" & Ming for providing the HTML.

I spent approximately 40 minutes on this lab.
